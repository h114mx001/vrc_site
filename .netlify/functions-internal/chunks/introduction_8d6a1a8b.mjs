It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.\n\nFound a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!\n\nGood luck out there, Astronaut. üßë‚ÄçüöÄ\n";
